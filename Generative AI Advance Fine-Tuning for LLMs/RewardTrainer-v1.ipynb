Your task is to evaluate and select the best large language model (LLM) that can understand and follow complex instructions, improve the quality of automated customer service, and generate high-quality responses.\n","\n","However, simply choosing a powerful LLM isn't enough. To truly excel in these tasks, the model should be fine-tuned to align with specific goals and criteria. This is where reward models come into the picture. By training a reward model, you can guide the LLM to prioritize certain behaviors, ensuring it generates responses that not only meet technical standards but also align with the company's values and objectives.\n","\n","In this hands-on lab, you dive into the process of creating and training a reward model by using the transformer reinforcement learner (trl) library from Hugging Face. You learn how to set up the environment, define the rewards that shape the model's behavior, and fine-tune the LLM to perform with precision. This project equips you with the skills to implement reward models in real-world applications, enhancing the effectiveness and quality of AI-powered products.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2463753f-6431-446f-90f3-2ec7f3703b4b","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["## __Table of Contents__\n","\n","<ol>\n","    <li><a href=\"#Objectives\">Objectives</a></li>\n","    </ul>\n","    <li><a href=\"#Setup\">Setup</a></li>\n","    <ul>\n","        <li><a href=\"#Installing-required-libraries\">Installing required libraries</a></li>\n","        <li><a href=\"#Importing-required-libraries\">Importing required libraries</a></li>\n","        <li><a href=\"#Defining-helper-functions\">Defining helper functions</a></li>\n","    </ul>\n","    <li><a href=\"#Dataset\">Data set</a></li>\n","    <ul>\n","        <li><a href=\"#Purpose\">Purpose</a></li>\n","        <li><a href=\"#Applications\">Applications</a></li>\n","        <li><a href=\"#Dataset-features\">Data set features</a></li>\n","    </ul>\n","    <li><a href=\"#Model-and-tokenizer-Setup\">Model and tokenizer setup</a></li>\n","    <li><a href=\"#Preprocessing\">Preprocessing</a></li>\n","    <ul>\n","        <li><a href=\"#LoRA-configuration\">LoRA configuration</a></li>\n","        <li><a href=\"#Training-arguments\">Training arguments</a></li>\n","        <li><a href=\"#Reward-Trainer\">Reward trainer</a></li>\n","    </ul>\n","    <li><a href=\"#Evaluating-the-model\">Evaluating the model</a></li>\n","    <li><a href=\"#Exercise\">Exercise</a></li>\n","</ol>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d5d75658-6c7f-4d57-9881-92b690b9a9c4","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Objectives\n","After completing this lab, you are able to:\n","\n","- Understand the concept of reward modeling in machine learning\n","- Explore and preprocess a data set for reward modeling tasks\n","- Set up and configure a GPT-2 model for sequence classification\n","- Tokenize and prepare text data for model training\n","- Evaluate model performance using pairwise comparison of responses\n","- Apply preprocessing and evaluation techniques to different subsets of data\n","- Understand important concepts related to transformers and reward modeling\n","- Implement special tokens in the tokenizer and configure the model accordingly\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f70ae2bc-674f-4ea6-9c83-92b5a29ecfec","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Setup\n","## Installing required libraries\n","Before you start, make sure that you have all of the necessary libraries installed.
